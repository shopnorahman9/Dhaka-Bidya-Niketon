            <p class="sectionsub-tag text-small">The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for
                learning has existed since Classical antiquity. Formal schools have existed at least since ancient
                Greece (see Academy), ancient Rome (see Education in Ancient Rome) ancient India (see Gurukul), and
                ancient China (see History of education in China). The Byzantine Empire had an established schooling
                system beginning at the primary level. According to Traditions and Encounters, the founding of the
                primary education system began in 425 AD and "... military personnel usually had at least a primary
                education ...". The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated
                citizens were a must.</p>

            <p class="sectionsub-tag text-small">A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning
                spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most
                countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students
                progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the
                Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for
                teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is
                commonly called a university college or university.</p>

            <p class="sectionsub-tag text-small">Islam was another culture that developed a school system in the modern
                sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and
                spreading knowledge, and purpose-built structures. At first, mosques combined both religious performance
                and learning activities, but by the 9th century, the madrassa was introduced, a school that was built
                independently from the mosque, such as al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 859 CE. They were also the first to
                make the Madrassa system a public domain under the control of the Caliph.
